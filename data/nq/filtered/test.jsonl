{"example_id": 6556718257422998662, "question": "what is the first step in the evolution of the eye", "context": "The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light , found even in unicellular organisms , called `` eyespots '' . Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination , organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation .", "answers": ["eyespots", "photoreceptor proteins that sense light"]}

Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi . It has been recorded in Nova Scotia , Canada , in Columbus , Ohio , and in all five boroughs of New York City .", "answers": ["in 1876", "1876"]}

The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that `` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence . What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology ?

Eliot , who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics . Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work . The `` occasion '' of E. Montale is a further form of correlative .", "answers": ["T.S. Eliot"]}

Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 , Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould .

This early development is critical for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development . The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around day 21 or 22 . The heart begins to develop near the head of the embryo in the cardiogenic area . Following cell signalling , two strands or cords begin to form in the cardiogenic region As these form , a lumen develops within them , at which point , they are referred to as endocardial tubes . At the same time that the tubes are forming other major heart components are also being formed . The two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a single primitive heart tube , the tubular heart which quickly forms five distinct regions . From head to tail , these are the truncus arteriosus , bulbus cordis , primitive ventricle , primitive atrium , and the sinus venosus . Initially , all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus , and contractions propel the blood from tail to head , or from the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus . The truncus arteriosus will divide to form the aorta and pulmonary artery ; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right ventricle ; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle ; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages , and the sinus venous will develop into the posterior part of the right atrium , the sinoatrial node and the coronary sinus .", "answers": ["week 4 of development", "by week 4 of development"]}

{"example_id": 6276969298797177537, "question": "what is the main objective of criminal law", "context": "Retribution -- Criminals ought to Be Punished in some way . This is the most widely seen goal . Criminals have taken improper advantage , or inflicted unfair detriment , upon others and consequently , the criminal law will put criminals at some unpleasant disadvantage to `` balance the scales . '' People submit to the law to receive the right not to be murdered and if people contravene these laws , they surrender the rights granted to them by the law . Thus , one who murders may be executed himself . A related theory includes the idea of `` righting the balance . '' Deterrence -- Individual deterrence is aimed toward the specific offender . The aim is to impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior . General deterrence aims at society at large . By imposing a penalty on those who commit offenses , other individuals are discouraged from committing those offenses . Incapacitation -- Designed simply to keep criminals away from society so that the public is protected from their misconduct . This is often achieved through prison sentences today . The death penalty or banishment have served the same purpose . Rehabilitation -- Aims at transforming an offender into a valuable member of society . Its primary goal is to prevent further offense by convincing the offender that their conduct was wrong . Restoration -- This is a victim - oriented theory of punishment . The goal is to repair , through state authority , any injury inflicted upon the victim by the offender . For example , one who embezzles will be required to repay the amount improperly acquired . Restoration is commonly combined with other main goals of criminal justice and is closely related to concepts in the civil law , i.e. , returning the victim to his or her original position before the injury .", "answers": ["Restoration", "Retribution", "Deterrence", "Incapacitation", "Rehabilitation"]}

One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned . Soon after , filming moved to Kanab , Utah . On October 24 , 1975 , Kaufman was fired at Eastwood 's command by producer Bob Daley . The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives , since the director had already worked hard on the film , including completing all of the pre-production . Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down , but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine , reported to be around $60,000 for the violation . This resulted in the Director 's Guild passing new legislation , known as ' the Eastwood Rule ' , which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself .

{"example_id": -5935683210985272192, "question": "when did the steel mills closed in youngstown ohio", "context": "Youngstown Sheet and Tube 's announcement had a ripple effect in the area . In 1979 -- 1980 , U.S. Steel pulled out of the Youngstown area and started scaling back its operations in Pittsburgh before eventually merging with Marathon Oil and filing with bankruptcy . In the mid-1980s , Republic Steel also filed for bankruptcy . Attempts to revive the local steel industry proved unsuccessful . Shortly after the closure of most of Youngstown Sheet and Tube 's area operations , local religious leaders , steelworkers , and activists such as Staughton Lynd participated in a grassroots effort to purchase and refurbish one of the company 's abandoned plants in neighboring Campbell , Ohio . This project met with failure in April 1979 . The failure to reopen the mills led Youngstown State University professors Terry Buss and F. Stevens Redburn to conclude that the mill closings resulted from forces beyond the control of the community . Youngstown was simply just one piece of a national problem , and there was no way that Youngstown could solve this problem alone . In 1982 , Staughton Lynd wrote about the effects of the mill closings in Youngstown in the book entitled The Fight Against Black Monday . In the wake of the steel plant shutdowns , the community lost an estimated 40,000 manufacturing jobs , 400 satellite businesses , $414 million in personal income , and from 33 to 75 percent of the school tax revenues . The Youngstown area has yet to fully recover from the loss of jobs in the steel sector .", "answers": ["September 19 , 1977"]}

This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a ( single ) nucleated cell . This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel 's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development , including generation of the first nucleated cell from a `` monerula '' , a structureless mass of primordial mucus ( `` Urschleim '' ) . Therefore , the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time . However , Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups , including amphibians and molluscs . Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884 . This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity . In 1873 , August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity . The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later , after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century ; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed .", "answers": ["Cell nuclei", "the nucleus", "chromosome", "nucleus"]}

{"example_id": 203990708221890305, "question": "who proposed evolution in 1859 as the basis of biological development", "context": "In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory , explained in detail in Darwin 's On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) . Unlike Lamarck , Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor . Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology . Debate over Darwin 's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution , but the specific mechanism he proposed , natural selection , was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s . Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution . Alternatives to natural selection suggested during `` the eclipse of Darwinism '' ( c. 1880 to 1920 ) included inheritance of acquired characteristics ( neo-Lamarckism ) , an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ) , and sudden large mutations ( saltationism ) . Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900 , was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher , J.B.S. Haldane , and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s , and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics . During the 1930s and 1940s population genetics became integrated with other biological fields , resulting in a widely applicable theory of evolution that encompassed much of biology -- the modern synthesis .", "answers": ["Alfred Russel Wallace", "Charles Darwin"]}

{"example_id": -4750130423799874111, "question": "this type of nuclear decay effectively turns a proton into a neutron", "context": "In nuclear physics , beta decay ( \u03b2 - decay ) is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta ray ( fast energetic electron or positron ) and a neutrino are emitted from an atomic nucleus . For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability . For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible , the energy release ( see below ) or Q value must be positive .", "answers": ["beta decay"]}

Woods is one of five players ( along with Gene Sarazen , Ben Hogan , Gary Player , and Jack Nicklaus ) to have won all four professional major championships in his career , known as the Career Grand Slam , and was the youngest to do so . Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row , accomplishing the feat in the 2000 -- 2001 seasons . This feat became known as the `` Tiger Slam '' . Woods set the all - time PGA Tour record for most consecutive cuts made , with 142 . The streak started in 1998 , he set the record at the 2003 Tour Championship with 114 ( passing Byron Nelson 's previous record of 113 and Jack Nicklaus at 105 ) and extended this mark to 142 before it ended on May 13 , 2005 at the EDS Byron Nelson Championship . Many consider this to be one of the most remarkable golf accomplishments of all time , given the margin by which he broke the old record and given that during the streak , the next longest streak by any other player was usually only in the 10s or 20s . It should be noted that when Byron Nelson played far fewer players made the cut in a given event . Woods has won a record 25.2 % ( 79 out of 313 ) of his professional starts on the PGA Tour .

{"example_id": -24389891156755530, "question": "what percentage of sunlight is captured by plants to convert it into food energy", "context": "where C H O is glucose ( which is subsequently transformed into other sugars , cellulose , lignin , and so forth ) . The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation . If photosynthesis is inefficient , excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus . Energy can be dissipated as heat ( non-photochemical quenching ) , or emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence .", "answers": ["45 %", "3 to 6 %"]}

After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere . Once in the stratosphere , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond .", "answers": ["late 1970s", "1970s", "1974", "1973"]}

{"example_id": 923934477516364422, "question": "who enforces the charter of rights and freedoms", "context": "One of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly expand the scope of judicial review , because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Bill of Rights . The courts , when confronted with violations of Charter rights , have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations , as they did when Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism . The Charter , however , granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials . These powers are greater than what was typical under the common law and under a system of government that , influenced by Canada 's parent country the United Kingdom , was based upon Parliamentary supremacy . As a result , the Charter has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased judicial power . The Charter only applies to government laws and actions ( including the laws and actions of federal , provincial , and municipal governments and public school boards ) , and sometimes to the common law , not to private activity .", "answers": ["Supreme Court of Canada", "courts", "The courts", "the courts"]}
